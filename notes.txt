# JSON_Exercise

3/10/16
Initial Upload: I created a previous java object serialization project, but realized I didn't use JSON. This project uses JSON to take a java object and convert it to a JSON string that the user gives.

This project uses the json-simple.jar which is used as a referenced library.

This is tested and working.
